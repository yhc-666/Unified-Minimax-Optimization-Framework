Based on my analysis, here are the safe batch sizes for each dataset:

  Dataset Dimensions:

  - Coat: 290 users × 300 items = 87,000 total pairs
  - Yahoo: 15,401 users × 1,000 items = 15,401,000 total pairs
  - Kuai: 7,163 users × 10,596 items = 75,900,948 total pairs

  Safe Batch Size Calculation:

  Since the code uses x_all_idx = 
  ul_idxs[G*idx*self.batch_size:G*(idx+1)*self.batch_size] where G=4 by
   default, the constraint is:

  max_batch_size < (num_users × num_items) / G

  Safe Batch Sizes:

  1. Coat Dataset

  - Maximum safe batch size: 21,750
  - Recommended: ≤ 20,000 (with safety margin)
  - Currently used: 128 (very safe)

  2. Yahoo Dataset

  - Maximum safe batch size: 3,850,250
  - Recommended: ≤ 3,000,000 (with safety margin)
  - Currently used: 4,096 (very safe)

  3. Kuai Dataset

  - Maximum safe batch size: 18,975,237
  - Recommended: ≤ 15,000,000 (with safety margin)
  - Currently used: 4,096 (very safe)

  Additional Considerations:

  1. Memory constraints: Even if mathematically safe, very large batch
  sizes may cause GPU/CPU memory issues
  2. Training stability: Extremely large batches can hurt convergence
  3. Practical recommendations:
    - Coat: Stay below 10,000
    - Yahoo: Stay below 100,000
    - Kuai: Stay below 100,000

  The current batch sizes (128-4096) are well within safe limits for
  all datasets.
